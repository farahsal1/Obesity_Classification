## Dataset Description and Exploratory Analysis

The dataset obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository is
called ‘Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical
Condition’. The dataset consists of 2111 unique observations and 17
attributes that are as follows: Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Family
History, if the person eats high caloric food frequently, if the person
eats vegetables in meals, number of meals in a day, if the individual
eats between meals, smoking, amount of water intake, frequency of
physical activity, time on technological devices, frequency of alcohol
intake and mode of transportation. Out of these, some are numeric
variables for example age, weight and height, while others are
categorical variables such as gender, smoking and transportation.

The relationship between the predictor variables and the response
